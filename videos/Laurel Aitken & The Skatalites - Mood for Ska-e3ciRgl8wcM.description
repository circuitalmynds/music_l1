"Mood for Ska"

I'm in the mood for ska
simply because you're near me
funny but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for ja

heaven is in your eyes
bright as the stars we're under
oh is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for ska


why stop to think that whether
each little dream I pray
we'll put our hearts together
now we are one, I'm not afraid

if there's a cloud above
if it should rain well let it
over tonight forget it
we're in the mood for ska
