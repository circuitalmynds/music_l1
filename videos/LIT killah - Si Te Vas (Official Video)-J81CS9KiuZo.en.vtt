00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.560
I don’t care if she calls if it is at night or at dawn

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.640
because I’m not available for you

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.220
I know you’re jealous
but anyway we have no relation

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.780
 so forget me love

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.100
I no longer die for you

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.240
Yeaah

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.480
I don’t die for you

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.980
Yeaah

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.900
Many women are better than you

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.760
I don’t want to see you any more

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.300
And now tell me if you go

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.520
I won’t look for you

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.900
You’re mad about me

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.560
And now I don’t want to see you, see you

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.220
And now tell me if you go
I won’t look for you

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.140
You’re mad about me

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.880
And now I don’t want to see you, see you

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.800
When she sees me, she remembers
I’m good at it

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.320
She wants to be back, she wants to have
what she can’t have, she doesn’t understand

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.800
She will not accept that this is finished
bad woman, bad woman

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.240
Now it’s your turn to lose, I will not 
play your game

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.780
it’s you who will fall head over heels for me

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.840
Asking to come back, but it will not happen

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.220
even if you can’t wipe off those mascara marks

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.760
So you’ll stay alone now, lonely,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.520
I will go away from the problems

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.040
I want to enjoy the full night
Don’t fuck with me

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.340
at least for  now

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.460
And if you speak to me only tell me you’re leaving

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.240
I will not look for you

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.860
You’re mad about me and now I don’t want to see you, see you

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.420
And now tell me if you’re leaving
I will not look for you

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.960
You’re mad about me and now I don’t want 
to see you, see you

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.280
I worshipped you without knowing
that when you were with me you kissed other lips

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.310
You forgot me, you failed me and now
the blame

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.290
follows me everywhere, booze night

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.480
nights of madness and treason made you forget
all what you are regretting today

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.760
and you apologize but I said no no no no

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.160
Baby I said no

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.620
I no longer die for you…

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.040
Yeaah I don’t die for you yeeeah

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.920
There are many women better than you
I don’t want to see you anymore

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.700
And now tell me if you are leaving
I will not look for you

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.540
You’re mad about me
and I don’t want to see you

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.120
And now tell me if you are leaving
I will not look for you

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:31.440
You’re mad about me
and I don’t want to see you, see you
