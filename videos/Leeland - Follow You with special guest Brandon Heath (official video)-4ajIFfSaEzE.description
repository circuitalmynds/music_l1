In the 1970s, 2 million citizens of Cambodia were brutally killed by the Khmer Rouge. In 2009, Leeland and Brandon Heath spent a week in Cambodia with Food For the Hungry (www.fh.org). Through Christian love, God continues to bring healing to this nation in amazing ways. For more information, visit www.leelandonline.com.
